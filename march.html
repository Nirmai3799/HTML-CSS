<p> Gandhi returned to active politics in <b>1930</b> to protest Britain’s Salt Acts, which not only prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt—a dietary staple—but imposed a heavy tax that hit the country’s poorest particularly hard. Gandhi planned a new <b>Satyagraha campaign</b>, The Salt March, that entailed a 390-kilometer/240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he would collect salt in symbolic defiance of the government monopoly.</p>
<p><b>“My ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence and thus make them see the wrong they have done to India,”</b> he wrote days before the march to the British viceroy, Lord Irwin.
Wearing a homespun white shawl and sandals and carrying a walking stick, Gandhi set out from his religious retreat in Sabarmati on <b>March 12, 1930</b>, with a few dozen followers. By the time he arrived 24 days later in the coastal town of Dandi, the ranks of the marchers swelled, and Gandhi broke the law by making salt from evaporated seawater.
The Salt March sparked similar protests, and mass civil disobedience swept across India. Approximately 60,000 Indians were jailed for breaking the Salt Acts, including Gandhi, who was imprisoned in May 1930.
Still, the protests against the Salt Acts elevated Gandhi into a transcendent figure around the world. He was named Time magazine’s <b>“Man of the Year”</b> for 1930.
Gandhi was released from prison in <b>January 1931</b>, and two months later he made an agreement with Lord Irwin to end the <b>Salt Satyagraha</b> in exchange for concessions that included the release of thousands of political prisoners.</p>
