<p> Since Gandhiji wanted to live like a simple peasant and to serve the nation through constructive and rural re-construction work, he emphasised the need of Ashram where the workers could be trained for bringing his dreams into reality. He had been thinking of moving to a village in order to engage himself directly in the work of rural reconstruction. In the mean time <b>Jamnalal Bajaj</b> suggested him for establishing the Ashram in a village, about four miles from Wardha. Most of the land of this village belonged to jamnalal bajaj Gandhiji accepted the proposal and decided to move to <b>Sevagram</b> from <b>Maganwadi</b>. The " Ashram had been set up under the direction of Bapu in the village <b>"Segaon"</b> in 1936, which has latter been named as <b>"Sevagram Ashram"</b> (Service village).</p>
<p>A cottage, now called <b>Adi Niwas</b>, was soon constructed by Jamnalal Bajaj for Gandhiji. For several months, one corner of the cottage was occupied by him, the second by Kasturba, the third by Mahadev Desai and the fourth by an important guest who happened to be in Segaon to meet Gandhiji. Badshah Khan stayed in this fourth corner for several months. It was only after a year or two that a separate cottage was constructed for <b>Kasturba</b>. Subsequently, Gandhiji also shifted to another hut which was originally prepared by Miraben for her own use in the village. It is this hut which is now known as <b>Bapu Kutir</b> and where Gandhiji lived most of the time till 1946 when he left for Noakhali and never returned to Sevagram. In fact many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India was taken in this little hut of Gandhiji at Sevagram Ashram which was aptly spoken in the words of late Shri <b>J. C. Kumarappa</b>, "the de facto capital of India since service of the country is the function of a capital city".</p>
